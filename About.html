                    <h1>GITAM Deemed To Be University</h1>
                    <p>Providing library facilities to the students and staff started with the introduction of academic programmes. The library activity of GITAM began with setting up a library for the College of Engineering in 1980. This was added by the library of the College of Management studies in 1988 and the library of GIFT in 1997. The need to centralise the library facility was felt to optimise resource utilisation and maximise user convenience. Accordingly, GITAM management took the bold step of constructing a massive building of architectural excellence with all modern gadgets. The central library was commissioned in 2002 and transformed into Knowledge Resource Center (KRC). The building was located at the heart of the campus overlooking the vast expanse of acres. The hillock of Rushikonda, the legendary abode of saints, surrounded by green pastures and the blue ocean, are some of the visual delights in the vast panoramic view from the library.
                        KRC is the soul of GITAM (Deemed to be University). It constantly strives to realise the university's visitors, mission and objectives through its resources and services.</p>
